# [Sleek] CLI

> **Development tools specialized for [sleek]**

## Here be dragons

This, or on that matter [Sleek], is not even _close_ to being production ready.
It's and Sleek are missing many essential features. But it would be awesome if
you could test it out!

## Installation

[Sleek] and this CLI is built in Deno, so you will need to install Deno first.

Then run:

```console
$ you@computer deno install -A --unstable --quiet -n sleek https://deno.land/x/sleek_cli@v1.0.0/mod.ts
```

## Using

There are three main commands:

- `sleek new`: Create a new sleek project
- `sleek dev`: Start a dev server
- `sleek build`: Build your project
